## About Me

Success comes when _you're in love with what you do_. That's what I strive for. Once I fell in love with languages and became a translator (been working for more that 9 years). Then I found some beautiful meanings in photography and started creating memories for people and for myself. And as I see it now the most important thing photography brought me is the understanding of light. It gives some possibilities if you want to be creative.
Moreover recently I've had half an eye on development and this thing makes me very curious. I'm gonna get some goals achieved.
